     * Task 1.
     * Recall that Commands are required to hint to the intention of the transaction as well as take a list of
     * public keys as parameters which correspond to the required signers for the transaction.
     * Commands also become more important later on when multiple actions are possible with an AssetState, e.g. Trade
     * and Transfer.
     * TODO: Add an "Issue" command to the AssetContract and check for the existence of the command in the verify function.
     * Hint:
     * - The command should be defined inside [AssetContract].
     * - You can use the [requireSingleCommand] function on [tx.commands] to check for the existence and type of the specified command
     *   in the transaction.
     * - We usually encapsulate our commands around an interface inside the contract class called [Commands] which
     *   implements the [CommandData] interface. The [Issue] command itself should be defined inside the [Commands]
     *   interface as well as implement it, for example:
     *
     *     interface Commands : CommandData {
     *         class X : Commands
     *     }
     *
     * - We can check for the existence of any command that implements [AssetContract.Commands] by using the
     *   [requireSingleCommand] function which takes a type parameter.

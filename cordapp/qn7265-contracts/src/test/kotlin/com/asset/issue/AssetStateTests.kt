/**
 * Practical exercise instructions.
 * Uncomment the first unit test [hasAssetAmountFieldOfCorrectType] then run the unit test using the
 * gradle command "./gradlew asset-contracts:test". This will run tests in the asset-contracts folder.
 * The gradle command "./gradlew test" will run all tests.
 * The test should fail because you need to make some changes to the AssetState to make the test pass. Read the TODO
 * under each task number for a description and a hint of what you need to do.
 * Once you have the unit test passing, uncomment the next test.
 * Continue until all the unit tests pass. :)
